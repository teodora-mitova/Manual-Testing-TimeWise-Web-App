# Manual Testing Project - TimeWise Web Application

This repository contains my work of **manually testing TimeWise Web Application**. The project is completed using a combination of manual testing techniques and test management tools. I was testing **basic functionalities of the App**, such as user registration, login, profile editing, task creation and management. I have documented around 30 test cases divided in several test scenarios and identified several bugs and issues.
